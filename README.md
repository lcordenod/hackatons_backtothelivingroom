# hackatons_backtothelivingroom

Creating a digital workplace to feel like at the office with your remote coworkers!

*Hackathon organized by 42 Entrepreneurs and School 42 from the 6th to 8th of May 2020*

## Intro

Covid-19 sent us all back to our living room which turned into an office for most of us. The coworkers we used to see everyday are now pixels on our screen. We need the best tools to make our new workplace, a better place to work. **Why wouldn't you help develop these tools ?**

## Stack

- Golang (draft server, not completed)
- MongoDB (draft DB, not completed)
- React JS (w/ Hooks and Contexts APIs)
- Materialize-UI front library
- Figma for prototyping/designs

## What happened during the marathon

### Night before it started

I wanted to work with one of my friend, also developer, on the hackaton project but unfortunately, he couldn't make it in the end, but I decide to still do it anyway.
So first thing I had to do after registering to the Hackaton was to find fellow teammates to collaborate on that project.

The event proposed to create teams of 2-4 people, and also offered a list of people looking for a team with their specific skilss.
Ideally, I was looking for another developer to get the most of what an MVP can provide but developers were really rare and as you can imagine, very solicited.

### What we achieved

During these two and a half days, I managed to find teammates in about half a day, I found two great guys, Naofel and Claire that helped building a concept around the hackaton's theme. Naofel acted as the Webdesigner of the team while Claire was managing UI/UX experience as well as our marketing pitch, on my side, I was managing the development and conception of the product.
My first idea was to conceive a platform that would benefit students to access IT tools when they are not given the chance to, enabling them to work from home. To do so, the platform would allow companies/thid parties to get rid of their unused electronic devices left in a drawer to benefit a young student in the need. Basically, the platform would be a link between schools and third parties to prepare/refurbish computers, tablets and smartphones for students in the need. Acting as an association, with no business objective apart from helping students, the idea was rejected, so we needed to find another concept. What we came up with was a platform that would enable remote coworkers to keep track of their e-colleagues information, chat, work and documents to ease communication, progress on projects and online team events.

We called it **BACK2WORK**

#### Why ?

Well, because sometimes working remotely can be complicated since colleagues might not use the same tools as you do, not be available at the same hours or even in the same time-zone, yes we think WORLDWIDE! and we want to make it easier for remote coworkers to feel like at the office.

#### How ?

**BACK2WORK** enables remote teams to collaborate thanks to a centralized interface where everyone know who is available, what colleagues are working on, and enough information to ease contact between each other (favorite communication mean, current software used...) as well as remote online events to maintain team spirit and getting to know colleagues.

#### Where did we get so far

In the short time that we had, we lost time as we switched from our initial concept, but we did great as we managed to come up with a new idea, develop a business model around it (watch the video above), build a communication (marketing pitch and video), design the platform and build a first initial version in development.

Here is a preview of the platform, to showcase what we managed to design and create in development:
