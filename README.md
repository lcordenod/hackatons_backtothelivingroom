# hackatons_backtothelivingroom

Creating a digital workplace to feel like at the office with your remote coworkers!

*Hackathon organized by 42 Entrepreneurs and School 42 from the 6th to 8th of May 2020*

## Intro

Covid-19 sent us all back to our living room which turned into an office for most of us. The coworkers we used to see everyday are now pixels on our screen. We need the best tools to make our new workplace, a better place to work. **Why wouldn't you help develop these tools ?**

### What happened during the marathon

#### Night before it started

I wanted to work with one of my friend, also developer, on the hackaton project but unfortunately, he couldn't make it in the end, but I decide to still do it anyway.
So first thing I had to do after registering to the Hackaton was to find fellow teammates to collaborate on that project.

The event proposed to create teams of 2-4 people, and also offered a list of people looking for a team with their specific skilss.
Ideally, I was looking for another developer to get the most of what an MVP can provide but developers were really rare and as you can imagine, very solicited.
